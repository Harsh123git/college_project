                    <div class="mem-details">
                        <p>Neibanuo is the only child of Mrs. Zaputuo Angami.
                            Along with her mother, Neibanuo looks after the
                            Kohima Orphanage and Destitute Home and has given
                            her whole life towards the care and support of the
                            children. Neibanuo has been serving the children
                            from a very early age having had to give up her
                            school education because there was no one else in
                            the house to help out. She took up a government job
                            in 1987 and married in 1988.
                            <br><br>
                            However, after 16 years she divorced from her
                            husband in 2003 with whom she has 3 children.
                            Neibanuo's greatest worry is about the financial
                            state of the home. The KODH has no stable source of
                            income and is managed only by free will donations by
                            well wishers. The state Government gives a small
                            grant every year which does not even cover the basic
                            cost of food. She looks after the small kitchen
                            garden from where the home gets its vegetables and
                            the few livestock the home keeps, which they sell in
                            times of grave financial need.
